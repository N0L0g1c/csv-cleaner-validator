## Description

This project provides a bash script to clean and validate large CSV datasets, automating tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and validating numeric columns. It generates a cleaned CSV and a report, making it ideal for data scientists preparing data for analysis or machine learning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Bash (available on Unix-like systems)
- `awk` and `sed` (typically pre-installed)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x clean_validate_csv.sh

## Usage
Run the script with an input CSV, output CSV, and a list of numeric column indices (1-based):

./clean_validate_csv.sh input.csv output.csv numeric_columns

Example:

./clean_validate_csv.sh data.csv cleaned_data.csv 2,3

This processes data.csv, ensures columns 2 and 3 are numeric, outputs cleaned_data.csv, and generates cleaning_report.txt.
